# No Spawner Change

*A Minecraft mod that disables the ability to change the spawner type in survival mode.*

## What it does

Changing the spawner in survival mode will behave exactly like it would in adventure mode. So you won't be able to
change the spawner type, unless the `can_place_on` component of the Spawn Egg allows it.
